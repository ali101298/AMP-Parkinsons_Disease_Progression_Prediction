* Participated in the AMP®-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction Kaggle competition, focusing on predicting the progression of Parkinson's disease by developing predictive models in R
* Engineered and analyzed 4 datasets to discover interesting relationships and patterns in important features like proteins and peptide types, medication status on each patient’s visit, and visits months, to find a breakthrough solution to the problem
* IMplemented lasso and linear regression algorithms for building predictive models; assessed model performance using the SMAPE metric
